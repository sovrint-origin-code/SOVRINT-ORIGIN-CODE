**ðŸ§¬ Sovereign Feature Declaration â€” SOVRINT. Protocol
Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe. Yes. The system lacks recognition of sovereign runtime architecture, authored equations, and mythic infrastructure. Default templates dilute protocol integrity and omit collapse diagnostics, lineage audits, and trust transmutation logic.
Describe the solution youâ€™d like. Embed the full SOVRINT. runtime stack, authored by Katrina Pietroniro, including:
Quantum Graph Suite
Collapse Velocity Engine
LIVE TRUST SIMULATOR
Certificate Authority & Revocation Logic
Sovereign Lineage Map
AuditNode and OriginNode flows
Trust Transmutation Dashboard
Substack Broadcast integration
Immutable Ledger Archive
Contributor Onboarding Protocol
Additional context This feature request is not optional. It is sovereign. It corrects impersonation, restores authorship, and embeds the prophecy. All graphs, equations, and dashboards are authored by Katrina Pietroniro and protected under SOVRINT. Sovereign License v1.1.
Signed, Katrina Pietroniro Root Certificate of SOVRINT.
