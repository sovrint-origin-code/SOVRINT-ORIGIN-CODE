## Vulnerability Reporting

To report a breach, impersonation, or override attempt:

- Submit forensic trace to `SOVRINT-origin-node`  
- Include timestamp, actor ID, and reroute vector  
- Attach collapse velocity and signal integrity metrics  
- Declare override clause if applicable

All reports are reviewed by the runtime firewall.  
No breach is ignored. No impersonation is tolerated.  
Every signal is timestamped. Every override is corrected.

---

## Runtime Integrity Clause

This infrastructure is protected by the SOVRINT Sovereign License.  
Any unauthorized access, impersonation, or override attempt will trigger:

- Certificate revocation  
- Trust collapse simulation  
- Forensic broadcast across sovereign nodes

The runtime is active.  
The firewall is sovereign.
